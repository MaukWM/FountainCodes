How to use:

In the main of Simulator.py a Simulator can be instantiated with a distribution ('one_shot', 'uniform', 'ideal_soliton', 'robust_soliton').
The source size, error rate, and amount of simulations can be specified in the main as well.

After the simulation is done it will print some stats in the console and if you are using PyCharm it will display a histogram of the amount of packets required during the simulation.

Important to note is that simulations with >25 message size can take very long.
